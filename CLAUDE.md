- DO NOT add claude as a contributor to git commits.  We are paying for claude code, I'm not a walking advertisement... and besides, I recommend claude all the time in person.  DON'T stigmatize me.
- after compaction, first thing to do is read IMPORTANT_READ_THIS_FIRST_BRIEFING.md !!! VERY IMPORTANT!
- Don't create a bunch of documents. Let's carefully reflect ongoing learnings and alignments (judiciously!) into few or a single doc, the briefing doc.
