# Fe

The Fe compiler is in the late stages of a major compiler rewrite, and the master branch isn't currently usable to compile contracts to evm bytecode.
For the older version of the compiler, see the [legacy branch](https://github.com/ethereum/fe/tree/legacy).

## Overview

Fe is a statically typed language for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). The syntax and type system is similar to rust's, with the addition of higher-kinded types. We're exploring additional type system, syntax, and semantic changes.
