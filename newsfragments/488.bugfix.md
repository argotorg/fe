Ensure ternary expression short circuit.

Example:

```
contract Foo:

    pub fn bar(input: u256) -> u256:
        return 1 if input > 5 else revert_me()

    fn revert_me() -> u256:
        revert
        return 0
```

Previous to this change, the code above would **always** revert no matter
which branch of the ternary expressions it would resolve to. That is because
both sides were evaluated and then one side was discarded. With this change,
only the branch that doesn't get picked won't get evaluated at all.

The same is true for the boolean operations `and` and `or`.
