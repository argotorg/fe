Fix a bug that causes ICE when nested if-statement has multiple exit point.

E.g. the following code would previously crash the compiler but shouldn't:
```fe
 pub fn foo(self) {
    if true {
        if self.something { 
            return 
        }
    }
    if true {
        if self.something { 
            return 
        }
    }
}
```
