Give option to produce runtime bytecode as compilation artifact

Previously, the compiler could only produce the bytecode that is used
for the deployment of the contract. Now it can also produce the runtime
bytecode which is the bytecode that is saved to storage.

Being able to obtain the runtime bytecode is useful for contract
verification.

To obtain the runtime bytecode use the `runtime-bytecode` option
of the `--emit` flag (multiple options allowed).

Example Output:

- mycontract.bin (bytecode for deployment)
- mycontract.runtime.bin (runtime bytecode)
