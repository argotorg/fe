Support private fields on structs

Public fields now need to be declared with the `pub` modifier, otherwise they default to private fields.
If a struct contains private fields it can not be constructed directly except from within the
struct itself. The recommended way is to implement a method `new(...)` as demonstrated in the
following example.

```
struct House:
    pub price: u256
    pub size: u256
    vacant: bool

    pub fn new(price: u256, size: u256) -> House
      return House(price=price, size=size, vacant=true)

contract Manager:

  house: House

  pub fn create_house(price: u256, size: u256):
    self.house = House::new(price, size)
    let can_access_price: u256 = self.house.price
    # can not access `self.house.vacant` because the field is private
```
