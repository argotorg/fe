New `verify` command to verify onchain contracts against local source code.

People need to be able to verify that a deployed contract matches the source code
that the author claims was used to deploy it. Previously, there was no simple
way to achieve this.

These are the steps to verify a contract with the `verify` command:

1. Obtain the project's source code locally.
2. Ensure it is the same source code that was used to deploy the contract. (e.g. check out a specific tag)
2. From the project directory run `fe verify <contract-address> <json-rpc-url>`

Example:

```bash
$ fe verify 0xf0adbb9ed4135d1509ad039505bada942d18755f https://example-eth-mainnet-rpc.com
It's a match!âœ¨

Onchain contract:
Address: 0xf0adbb9ed4135d1509ad039505bada942d18755f
Bytecode: 0x60008..76b90

Local contract:
Contract name: SimpleDAO
Source file: /home/work/ef/simple_dao/fe_contracts/simpledao/src/main.fe
Bytecode: 0x60008..76b90

Hint: Run with --verbose to see the contract's source code.
```
