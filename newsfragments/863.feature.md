Fixed broken trait orphan rule

Fe has an orphan rule for Traits similar to Rust's that requires
that either the trait or the type that we are implementing the trait for
are located in the same ingot as the `impl`. This rule was implemented
incorrectly so that instead of requiring them to be in the same ingot,
they were required to be in the same module. This change fixes this
so that the orphan rule is enforced correctly.
