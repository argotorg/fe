Events can now be defined outside of contracts.

Example:
```
event Transfer:
    idx sender: address
    idx receiver: address
    value: u256

contract Foo:
    fn transferFoo(to: address, value: u256):
        emit Transfer(sender: msg.sender, receiver: to, value)

contract Bar:
    fn transferBar(to: address, value: u256):
        emit Transfer(sender: msg.sender, receiver: to, value)
```
