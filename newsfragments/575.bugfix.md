Fixed bug in left shift operation.

Example:

Let's consider the value `1` as an `u8` which is represented as
the following 256 bit item on the EVM stack `00..|00000001|`.
A left shift of `8` bits (`val << 8`) turns that into `00..01|00000000|`.

Previous to this fix this resulted in the compiler taking `256` as the
value for the `u8` when clearly `256` is not even in the range of `u8`
anymore. With this fix the left shift operations was fixed to properly
"clean up" the result of the shift so that `00..01|00000000|` turns into
`00..00|00000000|`.
