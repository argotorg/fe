Add basic support for structs.

Example:

```
struct House:
    price: u256
    size: u256
    vacant: bool

contract City:

    pub def get_price() -> u256:
        building: House = House(300, 500, true)

        assert building.size == 500
        assert building.price == 300
        assert building.vacant

        return building.price
```
