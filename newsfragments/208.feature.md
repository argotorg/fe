Add support for `block`, `msg`, `chain`, and `tx` properties:
```
block.coinbase: address
block.difficulty: u256
block.number: u256
block.timestamp: u256
chain.id: u256
msg.value: u256
tx.gas_price: u256
tx.origin: address
```
(Note that `msg.sender: address` was added previously.)

Example:
```
def post_fork() -> bool:
    return block.number > 2675000
```
