Perform type checking when calling event constructors

Previously, the following would not raise an error even though it should:

```
contract Foo:
    event MyEvent:
        val_1: string100
        val_2: u8

    pub def foo():
        emit MyEvent("foo", 1000)

```

Wit this change, the code fails with a type error as expected.
