Fixed an issue where generic parameters that were `mut` could not be satisfied at callsite.

For instance, the following code would previously cause a compile error but now works as expected:

```rust
struct Runner {
  pub fn run<T: Computable>(self, mut _ val: T) -> u256 {
    return val.compute(val: 1000)
  }
}

contract Example {
  pub fn run_test(self) {
    let runner: Runner = Runner();
    let mut mac: Mac = Mac();

    assert runner.run(mac) == 1001
  }
}
```
