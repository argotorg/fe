When the Fe compiler generates a JSON ABI file for a contract, the
"stateMutability" field for each function now reflects whether the function can
read or modify chain or contract state, based on the presence or absence of the
`self` and `ctx` parameters, and whether those parameters are `mut`able.

If a function doesn't take `self` or `ctx`, it's "pure".
If a function takes `self` or `ctx` immutably, it can read state but not mutate
state, so it's a "view"
If a function takes `mut self` or `mut ctx`, it can mutate state, and is thus
marked "payable".

Note that we're following the convention set by Solidity for this field, which
isn't a perfect fit for Fe. The primary issue is that Fe doesn't currently
distinguish between "payable" and "nonpayable" functions; if you want a function
to revert when Eth is sent, you need to do it manually
(eg `assert ctx.msg_value() == 0`).
