Make subsequently defined contracts visible.

Before this change:

```
# can't see Bar
contract Foo:
   ...
# can see Foo
contract Bar:
   ...
```

With this change the restriction is lifted and the following becomes possible.

```
contract Foo:
    bar: Bar
    pub def external_bar() -> u256:
        return self.bar.bar()
contract Bar:
    foo: Foo
    pub def external_foo() -> u256:
        return self.foo.foo()
```
