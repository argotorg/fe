Adjust numeric values loaded from memory or storage

Previous to this fix numeric values that were loaded from either memory or storage
were not properly loaded on the stack which could result in numeric values not
treated as intended.

Example:

```
contract Foo:

    pub fn bar() -> i8:
        let in_memory: i8[1] = [-3]
        return in_memory[0]
```

In the example above `bar()` would not return `-3` but `253` instead.
