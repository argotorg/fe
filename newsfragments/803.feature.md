Support for `Self` type

With this change `Self` (with capital `S`) can be used to refer
to the enclosing type in contracts, structs, impls and traits.

E.g.

```
trait Min {
  fn min() -> Self;
}

impl Min for u8 {
  fn min() -> u8 { // Both `u8` or `Self` are valid here
    return 0
  }
}
```

Usage: `u8::min()`
