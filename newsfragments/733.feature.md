Support passing nested struct types to public functions.

Example:
```
pub struct InnerStruct {
    pub inner_s: String<10>
    pub inner_x: i256
}

pub struct NestedStruct {
    pub inner: InnerStruct
    pub outer_x: i256
}

contract Foo {
    pub fn f(arg: NestedStruct) {
        ...
    }
}
```
