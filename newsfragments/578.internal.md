Added a new category of tests: differential contract testing.

Each of these tests is pased on a pair of contracts where one implementation
is written in Fe and the other one is written in Solidity. The implementations
should have the same public APIs and are assumed to always return identical
results given equal inputs. The inputs are randomly generated using `proptest`
and hence are expected to discover unknown bugs.
