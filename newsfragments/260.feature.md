Require structs to be initialized using keyword arguments.

Example:

```
struct House:
    vacant: bool
    price: u256
```

Previously, `House` could be instantiated as `House(true, 1000000)`.
With this change it is required to be instantiated like `House(vacant=true, price=1000000)`

This ensures property assignment is less prone to get mixed up. It also makes struct
initialization visually stand out more from function calls.
