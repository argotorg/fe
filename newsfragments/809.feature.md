Allow calls to type constructors for primitive types in constant expressions

E.g. these are now allowed:

```rust
const DAI_ADDR: address = address(0x6b175474e89094c44da98b954eedeac495271d0f)
const DAI_ERC: ERC = ERC(DAI_ADDR)
```

Note that contract type constructors are simply just addresses and thus treated as primitives.
