Ensure integer type constructor reject all expressions that aren't a numeric literal.
For instance, previously the compiler would not reject the following code even though it could not be guaranteed that `val` would fit into an `u16`.

```
pub def bar(val: u8) -> u16:
        return u16(val)
```

Now such code is rejected and integer type constructor do only work with numeric literals such as `1` or `-3`.
