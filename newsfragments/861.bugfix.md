Fixed resolving of generic arguments to associated functions.

For example, this code would previously crash the compiler:

```rust
...
  // This function doesn't take self
  pub fn run_static<T: Computable>(_ val: T) -> u256 {
    return val.compute(val: 1000)
  }
...

// Invoking it would previously crash the compiler
Runner::run_static(Mac())
...
```
