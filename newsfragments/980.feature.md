Support for dependencies that are resolved through git

Example:

```
[dependencies]
fpmath = { version = "1.0", source="https://github.com/bilgin-kocak/felang-fixedpoint",rev="0eb57d267f7f174419ee257f97d7e02eb3469712" }
```

In the example above, the `fpmath` ingot is resolved through git from the repository that is specified in the `source` field. The `rev` field is used to specify the commit hash that the dependency is resolved to and is mandatory to ensure git dependencies are always pinned down to specific commits.
