Implemented a `send_value(to: address, value_in_wei: u256)` function.

The function is similar to the [`sendValue` function by OpenZeppelin](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/5b28259dacf47fc208e03611eb3ba8eeaed63cc0/contracts/utils/Address.sol#L54-L59) with the differences being that:

1. It reverts with `Error(0x100)` instead of `Error("Address: insufficient balance")` to
safe more gas.

2. It uses `selfbalance()` instead of `balance(address())` to safe more gas

3. It reverts with `Error(0x101)` instead of `Error("Address: unable to send value, recipient may have reverted")` also to safe more gas.
