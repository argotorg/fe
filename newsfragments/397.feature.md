Labels are now required on function arguments. Labels can be omitted if the
argument is a variable with a name that matches the label, or if the function
definition specifies that an argument should have no label. Functions often take
several arguments of the same type; compiler-checked labels can help prevent
accidentally providing arguments in the wrong order.

Example:
```
contract CoolCoin:
  balance: Map<address, i256>
  loans: Map<(address, address), i256>

  pub fn demo(self, ann: address, bob: address):
    let is_loan: bool = false
    self.give(from: ann, to: bob, 100, is_loan)

  fn transfer(self, from sender: address, to recipient: address, _ val: u256, is_loan: bool):
    self.cred[sender] -= val
    self.cred[recipient] += val
    if is_loan:
      self.loans[(sender, recipient)] += val
```

Note that arguments must be provided in the order specified in the function
definition.

A parameter's label defaults to the parameter name, but can be changed by
specifying a different label to the left of the parameter name. Labels should be
clear and convenient for the caller, while parameter names are only used in the
function body, and can thus be longer and more descriptive.
In the example above, we choose to use `sender` and `recipient` as identifiers
in the body of `fn transfer`, but use labels `from:` and `to:`.

In cases where it's ideal to not have labels, e.g. if a function takes a single
argument, or if types are sufficient to differentiate between arguments, use `_`
to specify that a given parameter has no label. It's also fine to require labels
for some arguments, but not others.

Example:
```
fn add(_ x: u256, _ y: u256) -> u256:
  return x + y

contract Foo:
  fn transfer(self, _ to: address, wei: u256):
    pass

  pub fn demo(self):
    transfer(address(0), wei: add(1000, 42))
```
