Prevent multiple types with same name in one module.

Examples that now produce compile time errors:

```
type bar = u8
type bar = u16
```

or

```
struct SomeStruct:
    some_field: u8

struct SomeStruct:
    other: u8
```

or

```
contract SomeContract:
    some_field: u8

contract SomeContract:
    other: u8
```
