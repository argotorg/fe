Prevent multiple types with same name in one module.

Examples that now produce compile time errors:

```
type bar = u8
type bar = u16
```

or

```
struct SomeStruct:
    some_field: u8

struct SomeStruct:
    other: u8
```

or

```
contract SomeContract:
    some_field: u8

contract SomeContract:
    other: u8
```


Prevent multiple fields with same name in one struct.

Example that now produces a compile time error:

```
struct SomeStruct:
    some_field: u8
    some_field: u8
```


Prevent variable definition in child scope when name already taken in parent scope.

Example that now produces a compile time error:

```
pub def bar():
    my_array: u256[3]
    sum: u256 = 0
    for i in my_array:
        sum: u256 = 0
```
