Previously, constants would not be treated as such if they were imported from another file.

E.g. the following would previously not work but works now.

```
use constants::MAX_ITEMS

contract Foo {
    pub fn __init__() {
        let data: Array<u256, {MAX_ITEMS}> = [1; {MAX_ITEMS}]
        assert data[0] + data[1] == 2
    }
}
```
