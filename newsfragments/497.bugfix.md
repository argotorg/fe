Fixed an issue with a missing return statement not properly detected.

Previous to this fix, the following code compiles but it should not:

```
contract Foo:
    pub def bar(val: u256) -> u256:
        if val > 1:
            return 5
```

With this change, the compiler rightfully detects that the code is missing
a `return` or `revert` statement after the `if` statement since it is not
guaranteed that the path of execution always follows the arm of the `if` statement.
