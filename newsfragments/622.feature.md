A special function named `__call__` can now be defined in contracts. 

The body of this function will execute in place of the standard dispatcher when the contract is called.

example (with intrinsics):

```
contract Foo:
    pub fn __call__(self):
        unsafe:
            if __calldataload(0) == 1:
                __revert(0, 0)
            else:
                __return(0, 0)
```
