Add full support for empty Tuples.

All functions in Fe implicitly return an empty Tuple if they have no other return value.
However, before this change one was not able to use the empty Tuple syntax `()` explicitly.

With this change, all of these are treated equally:

```
contract Foo:

  pub def explicit_return_a1():
    return

  pub def explicit_return_a2():
    return ()

  pub def explicit_return_b1() ->():
    return

  pub def explicit_return_b2() ->():
    return ()

  pub def implicit_a1():
    pass

  pub def implicit_a2() ->():
    pass
```
