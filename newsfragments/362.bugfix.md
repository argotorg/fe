Properly reject code that creates a circular dependency when using `create` or `create2`.

Example, the follwing code is now rightfully rejected because it tries to create an
instance of `Foo` from within the `Foo` contract itself.

```
contract Foo:
  pub def bar()->address:
    foo:Foo=Foo.create(0)

    return address(foo)
```
