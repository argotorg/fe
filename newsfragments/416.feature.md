Types of integer literal are now inferred, rather than defaulting to `u256`.

```
contract C:

  def f(x: u8) -> u16:
    y: u8 = 100   # had to use u8(100) before
    z: i8 = -129  # "literal out of range" error

    return 1000   # had to use `return u16(1000)` before

  def g():
    self.f(50)
```

Similar inference is done for empty array literals. Previously, empty array
literals caused a compiler crash, because the array element type couldn't
be determined.
```
contract C:
  def f(xs: u8[10]):
    pass

  def g():
    self.f([])
```
(Note that array length mismatch is still a type error, so this code won't
actually compile.)
