Ensure negation is checked and reverts with over/underflow if needed.

Example:

The minimum value for an `i8` is `-128` but the maximum value of an `i8`
is `127` which means that negating `-128` should lead to an overflow since
`128` does not fit into an `i8`. Before this fix, negation operations where
not checked for over/underflow resulting in returning the oversized value.
