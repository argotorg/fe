Reject unary minus operation if the target type is an unsigned integer number.

Code below should be reject by `fe` compiler: 

```python 
contract Foo:
    pub fn bar(self) -> u32:
        let unsigned: u32 = 1
        return -unsigned
    
    pub fn foo():
        let a: i32 = 1
        let b: u32 = -a
```
