Added builtin copying methods `clone()` and `to_mem()` to reference types.


usage:

```
# copy a segment of storage into memory and assign the new pointer
my_mem_array = self.my_sto_array.to_mem()

# copy a segment of memory into another segment of memory and assign the new pointer
my_other_mem_array = my_mem_array.clone()
```
