Support for value assignments in declaration.

Previously, this code would fail:

```
another_reference: u256[10] = my_array
```

As a workaround declaration and assignment could be split apart.

```
another_reference: u256[10]
another_reference =  = my_array
```

With this change, the shorter declaration with assignment syntax is supported.
